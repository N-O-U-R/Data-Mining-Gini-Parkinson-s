Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier
Introduction
This repository contains a Python project that utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease in individuals based on various vocal measurements. The model is trained on a dataset comprising biomedical voice measurements from people with and without Parkinson's disease.

Features
Utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier with the Gini index.
Predicts Parkinson's disease status based on voice measurement inputs.
Includes a Streamlit-based user interface for easy interaction.
Provides a clear visualization of the decision tree for understanding the prediction logic.
Installation
To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system. The project is built using Python 3.x. Follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://https://github.com/N-O-U-R/Data-Mining-Gini-Parkinson-s.git
cd Data-Mining-Gini-Parkinson-s
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Unix or MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
Install Required Packages

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
To run the Streamlit app, execute:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The application should now be running on your local server (typically http://localhost:8501). Open the link in a web browser to interact with the application.

Usage
The user interface allows you to input various vocal measurements. Once you provide all the required inputs, the application will use the pre-trained decision tree model to predict whether these measurements indicate the presence of Parkinson's disease.
